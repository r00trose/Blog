#About This Blog

Welcome to my cybersecurity & OSINT corner! Here, I share my learning journey as a junior SOC analyst in training. Youâ€™ll find write-ups on incident response, threat intelligence, OSINT case studies, and hands-on labs (TryHackMe, LetsDefend, HackTheBox).

This blog is my way of documenting what I learn, breaking down complex concepts into simple notes, and hopefully helping others who are also starting their journey in cybersecurity.
